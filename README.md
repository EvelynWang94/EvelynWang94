### 📈 Quantitative Finance Projects

This repository contains a collection of my independent research projects in quantitative finance, focusing on factor construction, regression modeling, and cross-sectional backtesting.

Each folder documents a specific factor study or trading strategy, implemented in Python using `pandas`, `statsmodels`, and `matplotlib`. Most projects follow a full-cycle workflow: from data processing and factor construction to IC tests and portfolio backtests.
